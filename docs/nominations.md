# Nominations — Award System

Source: `packages/runner/src/hooks/useNominations.ts`

## Overview

When a tournament completes (phase `completed`, 2+ scored matches), the system generates a set of award nominations shown in a swipeable carousel. Awards recognize individual and pair achievements beyond the final standings.

The final output is an ordered array:

```
[podium medals] + [tier-weighted non-podium awards] + [lucky award]
```

## Award Categories

### Podium (always shown, up to 3)

| # | Title | Emoji | Criteria |
|---|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Champion | 🥇 | Rank 1 |
| 2 | Runner-up | 🥈 | Rank 2 |
| 3 | Third Place | 🥉 | Rank 3 |

Podium slots are skipped when ranks don't match position (e.g., ties).

### Non-Podium Awards (up to 23 possible)

Awards are evaluated against tournament data. Each has qualification criteria — not all will qualify in every tournament. In a typical tournament, 8–15 may qualify; up to 7 are shown.

### Lucky Award (always shown, 1)

| Title | Emoji | Criteria |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Lucky One / Lucky Ones | 🍀 | Randomly chosen competitor, seeded by tournament ID |

## Close-Game Threshold

Several awards reference a "close game" threshold:

```
closeThreshold = max(2, floor(pointsPerMatch × 0.15))
```

For a 21-point match this is 3 points; for a 32-point match it's 4.

## Slot Budget

The number of non-podium award slots scales with tournament size:

```
MAX_AWARDS = min(7, max(3, floor(competitorCount / 2)))
```

| Competitors | Slots |
|-------------|-------|
| 4–5 | 3 |
| 6–7 | 3 |
| 8–9 | 4 |
| 10–11 | 5 |
| 12–13 | 6 |
| 14+ | 7 |

## Rarity Tiers

Every non-podium award is assigned a tier that controls how often it appears across tournaments:

| Tier | Awards | Selection Weight | Appearance Feel |
|------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Legendary** | Undefeated, Giant Slayer, Comeback King, Nemesis | 15% of slots | Rare sighting — collectible |
| **Rare** | Dominator, Clutch Player, Iron Wall, Consistency Champion, Gatekeeper, Best Duo, Hot Streak Duo, Nearly There, Peacemaker | 30% of slots | Moderately unusual |
| **Common** | Point Machine, Quick Strike, See-Saw, Instant Classic, Battle Tested, Warrior, Offensive Powerhouse, Offensive Duo, Defensive Duo, Rubber Match | 55% of slots | Appear most tournaments |

Tier assignment reflects both the difficulty of the statistical achievement and the specificity of the conditions required. Legendary awards require rare tournament conditions (someone winning every game, a massive comeback from a losing start, etc.).

## Selection Algorithm

### Step 1: Tier Bucketing

After all qualifying awards are generated, each is tagged with its tier from the `AWARD_TIERS` map. Awards are then separated into three buckets (legendary, rare, common) and each bucket is independently shuffled using a seeded PRNG.

### Step 2: Weighted Slot Filling (with soft player cap)

For each of the `MAX_AWARDS` slots:

1. **Roll a tier** using a seeded random number:
   - `[0, 0.15)` → legendary
   - `[0.15, 0.45)` → rare
   - `[0.45, 1.0)` → common

2. **Pick an award** from that tier's queue, scanning for the first award that satisfies the per-player soft cap (see below). If the preferred tier is empty, fall back to adjacent tiers in priority order:
   - legendary → rare → common
   - rare → common → legendary
   - common → rare → legendary

3. **Record** the selection — increment each player name's award count.

### Step 3: Per-Player Soft Cap

To prevent one dominant competitor from collecting most awards:

- **Cap**: max 2 non-podium awards per player name
- During slot filling, any award where a player already has 2 selected awards is skipped in favor of the next qualifying award in the queue
- **Soft relaxation**: if the capped pass can't fill all slots (e.g., small tournament with few players), a second uncapped pass fills remaining slots from whatever awards remain

This ensures at least 3–4 different competitors are recognized in a 7-slot tournament.

### Step 4: Final Shuffle

The selected awards are shuffled one final time (seeded) so tiers are interleaved rather than clustered.

### Determinism

All randomness uses a seeded PRNG derived from the tournament's match IDs:

```
seed = hash of all match IDs across all rounds
```

This ensures the same tournament always produces the same award selection and order, while different tournaments produce different mixes.

## Visual Treatment

### In-App (NominationCard component)

| Tier | Border | Glow | Badge |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Common | Default (`--color-border`) | None | None |
| Rare | `--color-tier-rare` (violet) | 12px box-shadow + inset | Pill badge: "RARE" |
| Legendary | `--color-tier-legendary` (amber) | 16px box-shadow + inset | Pill badge: "LEGENDARY" |

### Share Image (Canvas renderer)

The `renderNominationImage()` function in `standingsImage.ts` mirrors the CSS treatment:
- Tier-colored border stroke (1.5px for rare/legendary vs 1px default)
- Shadow blur glow effect
- Rounded pill badge with tinted background above the emoji

### Per-Skin Color Overrides

Tier colors are defined globally as CSS variables:

```css
--color-tier-legendary: var(--amber-9);
--color-tier-legendary-tint: var(--amber-a3);
--color-tier-rare: var(--violet-9);
--color-tier-rare-tint: var(--violet-a3);
```

Two skins override the rare tier to avoid clashing with their violet/purple primary:

| Skin | Override | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Bold Tech | `--color-tier-rare: var(--crimson-9)` | Primary is `#8b5cf6` (identical to `--violet-9`) |
| Latte | `--color-tier-rare: var(--crimson-9)` | Primary is `#8839ef` (very close to `--violet-9` in light mode) |

The canvas renderer reads tier colors via `getComputedStyle`, so per-skin overrides are automatically reflected in shared images.

## Share Text

The `useShareText` hook generates a text representation of awards for messenger sharing. Awards are listed as:

```
`🧊 Clutch Player`  Alice — 3/4 close games won
```

The tier is not included in the text format — it's a visual-only treatment.
