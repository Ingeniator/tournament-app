# Maldiciones del Padel

Source: `packages/runner/src/components/maldiciones/`, `packages/runner/src/utils/maldiciones.ts`, `packages/runner/src/data/curseCards.ts`

## Overview

Maldiciones del Padel is an optional game mode that adds curse cards to tournament matches. Teams receive a hand of cards at tournament start and can cast one curse per match to disrupt their opponents before scoring. The mode adds a strategic layer on top of the standard tournament format.

When enabled, the mode is branded as "🎭 Maldiciones del Padel" across shared images, nomination cards, and exported text.

## Configuration

Enabled via checkbox in tournament setup. Requires selecting a **chaos level** that determines which card tiers are available.

| Setting | Type | Options |
|---------|------|---------|
| Enabled | `boolean` | Toggle on/off |
| Chaos Level | `ChaosLevel` | `lite`, `medium`, `hardcore` |

```typescript
// packages/common/src/types/tournament.ts
maldiciones?: { enabled: boolean; chaosLevel: ChaosLevel }
```

### Chaos Levels

| Level | Cards Available |
|-------|----------------|
| Lite | Green only (6 cards) |
| Medium | Green + Yellow (12 cards) |
| Hardcore | All cards (17 cards) |

## Card Dealing

Triggered once at tournament start (`GENERATE_SCHEDULE` action) via `dealMaldicionesHands()`.

- **Cards per team**: `Math.max(1, Math.floor(plannedRounds / 3))`
  - 3 rounds → 1 card, 6 rounds → 2 cards, 9 rounds → 3 cards
- Cards are randomly drawn from the chaos-level-eligible pool
- Each team also receives **one shield** (`hasShield: true`)
- Cards are not replenished — once dealt, that's the full hand

Storage: `tournament.maldicionesHands: { [teamId]: { cardIds: string[]; hasShield: boolean } }`

## Gameplay Flow

```
Before match scoring:
  1. Team with cards clicks ☠️ button → CurseCardPicker opens
  2. Select a card from hand
  3. Pick one opponent player as target
  4. Curse recorded on match, card removed from hand

Opponent response:
  - 🛡️ Block: USE_ESCUDO → curse marked shielded, shield consumed
  - 👎 Veto: VETO_MALDICION → curse removed, card returned to caster
  - Accept: play the match with curse active

After scoring:
  - Curse recorded permanently on match for history + awards
```

**Constraints:**
- Max 1 curse per match
- Can only cast before match is scored
- Cannot cast if hand is empty

## Curse Cards

Card names are kept in Spanish as brand names. Descriptions and details are translated via i18n.

## Shield Mechanic

- Each team starts with exactly **one** shield
- Blocks a curse when used (curse is marked as `shielded: true`)
- Both the shield and the curse card are consumed
- One-time use per team for the entire tournament
- Shielded curses still appear in history with 🛡️ prefix and strikethrough
