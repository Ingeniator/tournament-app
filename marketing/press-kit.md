## Full Description (150 words)

Tournament Manager is a free, open-source Progressive Web App that makes running sports tournaments effortless. Designed for padel, pickleball, and other racket sports, it supports six tournament formats: Americano, Mexicano, Mixicano, Team Americano, Team Mexicano, and King of the Court.

The app's schedule algorithm optimizes five fairness criteria simultaneously: partner variety, opponent balance, rest distribution, court allocation, and player coverage. This produces schedules that are provably fairer than manual organization.

Built as an offline-first PWA, it works without internet connection after initial load — essential for outdoor courts with poor connectivity. All data stays on the user's device.

Post-tournament, the app generates 26+ awards based on match statistics (Giant Slayer, Clutch Player, Comeback King, etc.), adding a fun competitive element. Results can be shared as images or text to any messenger.

Available in 7 languages with no signup, no ads, and no cost.
