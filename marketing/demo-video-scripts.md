## Recording Tips

1. **Device:** Use a real phone (iPhone or Samsung) for authentic feel
2. **Speed:** Use slight fast-forward (1.5x) for typing/setup, normal speed for key moments
3. **Touch indicators:** Enable touch indicators so viewers can follow taps
4. **Player names:** Use realistic first names, not "Player 1"
5. **Scores:** Use realistic scores (21-17, 21-14, etc.)
6. **Resolution:** Record at native resolution, export at platform-specific sizes
7. **No notifications:** Enable Do Not Disturb during recording
