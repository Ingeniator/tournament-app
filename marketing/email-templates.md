## 1. Club Partnership Outreach

**Subject:** Free tournament tool for your club — no cost, no catch

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I built a free, open-source web app called Tournament Manager that makes it easy to run Americano, Mexicano, and other tournament formats.

A few clubs and groups are already using it, and I thought it might be useful for [Club Name]'s social events.

**What it does:**
- Generates fair schedules in seconds (balanced partners, opponents, rest, courts)
- Live scoring and automatic standings on any phone
- Works completely offline — no WiFi needed at the courts
- Supports 6 formats: Americano, Mexicano, Mixicano, Team Americano, Team Mexicano, King of the Court
- Fun awards ceremony at the end (26+ auto-generated awards)

**What it costs:** Nothing. No signup, no ads, no subscription. It's a PWA — players just open a link in their browser.

I'd love to set up a quick demo at one of your next events, or you can try it yourself: tm.padel.wiki/play

Happy to answer any questions.

Best,
[Your name]
