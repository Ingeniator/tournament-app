## Problem / Solution

### The Old Way
- 20 minutes with a whiteboard
- Spreadsheet formulas for partner rotation
- "Why do I always sit out?"
- Manual score tracking on paper
- Arguments about fairness

### The Tournament Manager Way
- Open a link, add names, play
- Algorithm-generated fair schedules
- Balanced rest and court distribution
- Live scoring on every phone
- Automatic standings and awards

## Feature Blocks

### 6 Tournament Formats
Pick the right format for your group. Americano for social play, Mexicano for competitive matchups, King of the Court for fast-paced fun — and 3 more.

### Fair by Design
The schedule algorithm simultaneously optimizes partner variety, opponent balance, rest distribution, and court allocation. Mathematically fairer than any manual schedule.

### Works Offline
Load the app once, then run your entire tournament without internet. Scores, standings, schedule — everything stays on your phone. Perfect for outdoor courts.

### Awards Ceremony
26+ auto-generated awards based on match statistics. Giant Slayer. Clutch Player. Iron Wall. Comeback King. Every tournament tells a different story.

### Share Results
Send standings as images or text to WhatsApp, Instagram, or any messenger. Results include a link back to the app.

### Multi-Language
Available in English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Serbian, and Swedish. More coming.
